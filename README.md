# Windfall Client

Windfall is a web application lets you create a list of bills and see your net income. The live app is deployed at https://windfall-app.netlify.com.

It's built with React JS, React Redux, Redux Forms and a mobile-first design. I experimented a lot with reusable components (BillForm.js is used both to create new bills and to edit bills), stuck to an accessible color scheme, and will continue to review and tweak it for further accessbility.
